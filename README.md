## 📄 Description – Exercise Statement
This project consists of creating a Java class that manages a collection of books in a library. The class supports operations such as:

Adding books

Retrieving the full list of books

Getting a book by its position

Inserting a book at a specific position

Removing a book by its title

Additionally, the project includes a JUnit test class to verify the correctness of these operations.

## 💻Technologies Used
Java 17

IntelliJ IDEA (or any preferred Java IDE)

JUnit 5

Git & GitHub

## 📋Requirements
Java Development Kit (JDK) 17 or higher

JUnit 5 configured in the project (if using IntelliJ, JUnit can be added via project structure or Maven/Gradle)

Git installed (optional for version control)

## 🛠️Installation
Clone or download the project from the GitHub repository.

Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA or your preferred Java IDE.

Make sure the JDK is properly configured.

Ensure JUnit 5 is available in your project libraries.

## ▶️Execution
You can run the program in two ways:

✅ From the IDE:
Run the main method from the class responsible for the library logic (if available).

Run the JUnit test file to verify functionality.

✅ From the command line:
Compile the source file:

in bash:

-javac LibraryManager.java

Run the program (if a main method is available):

in bash: 

- java LibraryManager
- 
Run tests (from IDE or via a test runner):
JUnit is typically executed within an IDE or through a build tool like Maven or Gradle.

## 🌐Deployment
This is a local Java project for educational purposes, and it does not require deployment to a server.

However, it can be uploaded to a GitHub repository for version control, review, or collaboration.
